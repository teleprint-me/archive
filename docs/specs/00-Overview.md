# Overview

There are 3 types of averaging strategies for investing.

1. Cost Averaging
1. Dynamic Cost Averaging
1. Value Averaging

## Cost Averaging

---

**Cost Averaging** is an investment strategy where an investor invests the same amount of money in a target [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) at regular intervals over a certain period of time regardless of price. The goal of dollar-cost averaging is to lower an investors _average cost per share_ and _reduce the impact of volatility_ on the their portfolios. [[1]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) Cost Averaging encourages _Buying and Holding_. An investor typically doesn't sell and invests with a _long-term horizon_ in mind.

## Dynamic Cost Averaging

---

**Dynamic Cost Averaging** is the same as Cost Averaging with the key difference being that it encourages both _Buying and Selling_. This allows the investor to take profits when the opportunity presents itself while maintaining the benefits of lowering an investors _average cost per share_ and _reducing the impact of volatility_ on the their portfolios. An investor typically buys with a _long-term investment horizon_ and sells with _short-term profits_ in mind.

This is known as a passive investment strategy because it _may generate potential revenue_ allowing the investment to grow over time.

It's important to note that Dynamic Cost Averaging utilizes a factor based formula where Cost Averaging utilizes a fixed amount to reduce the impact of volatility.

## Value Averaging

---

**Value Averaging** is similar to Dynamic Cost Averaging with the key difference being that the investor sets a target growth rate. [[2]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value_averaging.asp) This allows the investor to buy or sell based on a target amount at a set interval. This method produces the potential for both _increased risk as well as increased reward_ while attempting to take advantage of potential market volatility.

This is also known as a passive investment strategy because it _may generate potential revenue_ allowing the investment to compound itself over time based on a growth rate.

It's important to note that Value Averaging utilizes a Compound Interest formula where Cost Averaging does not and Dynamic Cost Averaging calculates a factor based target.

**You**:

All 3 exchanges, Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Kraken, modules are similar in most ways, but also differ in very stuble and important ways. Each module is also attempting to solve a nuanced problem. If that solution is ignored, it can break the code for processing that exchange.

Take the parser's filter functions for all 3 which is the most similar and least likely for experiencing negative consequences from modification.

`archive/csv/coinbase/parser.py`:

```py
def filter_transactions(
    transactions: list[CoinbaseTransaction],
    included_assets: list[str],
    excluded_types: Optional[list[str]] = None,
) -> list[CoinbaseTransaction]:
    """Filter transactions based on product and type.

    Args:
        transactions: A list of CoinbaseTransactions.
        included_products: A list of strings representing the desired products.
        excluded_types: A list of strings representing the excluded transaction types.

    Returns:
        A list of filtered CoinbaseTransaction's.
    """

    filtered_transactions = []

    for transaction in transactions:
        if excluded_types and transaction.should_skip(excluded_types):
            continue

        if transaction.should_keep(included_assets):
            filtered_transactions.append(transaction)

    return filtered_transactions
```

`archive/csv/coinbase_pro/parser.py`:

```py
def filter_transactions(
    transactions: list[CoinbaseProTransaction],
    included_assets: list[str],
) -> list[CoinbaseProTransaction]:
    """Filter transactions based on product.

    Args:
        transactions: A list of CoinbaseProTransactions.
        included_products: A list of strings representing the desired products.

    Returns
        A list of filtered CoinbaseProTransaction's.
    """

    filtered_transactions = []

    for transaction in transactions:
        if transaction.should_keep(included_assets):
            filtered_transactions.append(transaction)

    return filtered_transactions
```

`archive/csv/kraken/parser.py`:

```py
def filter_transactions(
    transactions: list[KrakenTransaction],
    included_assets: list[str],
) -> list[KrakenTransaction]:
    """Filter transactions based on asset.

    Args:
        transactions: A list of transactions.
        included_assets: A list of strings representing the desired assets.

    Returns:
        A list of filtered transactions.
    """
    filtered_transactions = []

    for transaction in transactions:
        if transaction.should_keep(included_assets):
            filtered_transactions.append(transaction)

    return filtered_transactions
```

How would you simplify this?

**GPT-3.5**:

The existing implementations are already quite simple, so there is not much that can be simplified. However, if we wanted to reduce the amount of duplicated code, we could extract the filtering logic into a separate function and reuse it across all three parsers. Here is an example of how that could look:

```py
def filter_transactions(
    transactions: list[TransactionType],
    included_assets: list[str],
    excluded_types: Optional[list[str]] = None,
) -> list[TransactionType]:
    """Filter transactions based on product and type.

    Args:
        transactions: A list of transactions.
        included_assets: A list of strings representing the desired assets.
        excluded_types: A list of strings representing the excluded transaction types.

    Returns:
        A list of filtered transactions.
    """
    filtered_transactions = []

    for transaction in transactions:
        if excluded_types and transaction.should_skip(excluded_types):
            continue

        if transaction.should_keep(included_assets):
            filtered_transactions.append(transaction)

    return filtered_transactions
```

We would then define `TransactionType` as a union of the different transaction types:

```py
from typing import Union

TransactionType = Union[CoinbaseTransaction, CoinbaseProTransaction, KrakenTransaction]
```

This would allow us to reuse the `filter_transactions` function across all three parsers without having to duplicate the code.
